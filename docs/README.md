# Documentation

Contains the [user manual](manual.md) and examples from executions gathered during my work.

Examples are:
* [Execution logs](examples/apply-del-public-cloud.md) of the first version of the deployer using the discontinued apply script (at bsc-env/apps/apply.sh).
* Example logs of each setup (1 to 7) and teardown (12 to 17) steps from the setup script.
* Example logs of bsc-artifactory (only start is logged)
* Example logs of bsc-deployer executing a few deployments
* Example logs of legacyctld executing a few deployments (no change after the first one)

For the best experience when viewing the logs (`examples/*.log`) use e.g. `less -R setup-step1.log` to correctly display all the control and unicode characters.
